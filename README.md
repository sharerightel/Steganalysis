# Implementing a Standard Deep Learning Approach by Tensorflow for Steganalysis

Deep learning refers to the shining branch of machine learning that is based on learning levels of representations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is one kind of deep neural network can be used for images recognition, image classification, object detection and face recognition. Using CNN in information hiding detection is the main purpose of this project. In this project, the particular CNN is applied to some images for distinguishing between stego images and clean images.  

## Getting Started

According to CNN advantages, in this project, a CNN is developed for distinguishing the stego-image form clean image. For this reason, TensorFlow is used for implementing the CNN. TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google. 

### Prerequisites

For run this project, you should activate TensorFlow on your system. You can follow the instruction of: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/  -
You should create some folders (coverdirectory, stegdirectory, and network) that contain cover images, stego images and the model (If you hav not any model, you can run the project for creating it).  

### Installing

You cn run the project by: 

`python Steganalysis_Tensorflow.py `
